# inv-pendulum-sim
A simple digital simulation of the inverted pendulum on a cart problem, implementing RL and PID controllers, made by the S.N. Bose team for Milan '24

The cart is able to move quite decently and the pendulum can balance, and this can be tested by using the arrow keys to move the cart to check whether the pendulum balances itself on addition of a force
